1.  The importance of focus: It’s more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.
    
2.  Hard work: You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot.
    
3.  Being internally driven: The most successful people are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world.
    
4.  Owning things: You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value. This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things.
    
5.  Building a network: Developing a network of talented people to work with is an essential part
    
6.  Taking risks: Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.
    
7.  Being bold: Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.
    
8.  Being hard to compete with: If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money. The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage.
    
9.  Being willful: The people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out” go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.
    
10.  Making it easy to take risks: Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works.
    

Overall, these points emphasize the importance of focus, hard work, and being internally driven to succeed. It also highlights the importance of taking risks, being bold, and building a strong network to become successful. Additionally, it stresses the value of owning things and being hard to compete with while being willful and making it easy to take risks.

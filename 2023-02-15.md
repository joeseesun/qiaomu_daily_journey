最近尝试用ChatGPT生成每日单词学习素材，方法如下：

一、指定一个单词，给出音标和例子、中文释义，再生成测试题和答案。

```
Give me the Chinese and English definition and pronunciation of "{{word}}." Use it in three sample sentences under 20 words. Then give me three multiple-choice questions on the usage of "{{word}}", each with only one correct answer. Show the answers after all the questions altogether. The first line of your answer should be the word itself. Put "{{word}}" and its definitions in bold.
```


二、用这个词生成A1难度的英文故事

```
Create an intriguing tale that includes repetition of the designated word, making sure the story is suitable for an A1 level audience.
```

三、生成工作场景对话
```
Think of two most possible scenarios in a tech company using '{{word}}'. Produce one dialogue between two different roles for each scenario , each with 4 lines. Put titles in bold.
```

四、生成单词填空
```
Craft a sentence that repeatedly features the word "{{word}}" while leaving gaps for others to fill in.
```

五、拓展词汇
```
Provide a list of English words that share the same affix or root as "cool," along with their corresponding Chinese definitions.
```

实验过程，有几个发现：
- AI生成的情景对话最有学习价值，可能跟工作最相关。
- 生成的内容结构不稳定，偶尔缺单词、格式错乱，仍需要一些人工校对。
- 写好的Prompt可以让AI重写，语法更准确、顺畅。
